# RELEASE 000 — MASTER PLAN

**Binding Scaffolding for Master Development Plan.**

## Status
This folder collects the independent Master Plans from Antigravity and Claude Code.
Current Priority: **Release 000 (Planning Round)**

## Required Files
- `MASTER_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN_v1_ANTIGRAVITY.md`
- `MASTER_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN_v1_CLAUDE.md`

## Length & Depth Aspiration
“~40 pages” is an aspiration, not a hard requirement. The hard requirement is **Completeness**.
The plan must cover:
1.  **Engine Architecture** (SimCore vs World split)
2.  **Feature Roadmap** (Phase 0..3 with dependencies)
3.  **Netcode Strategy** (Determinism, State Surface, Transport)
4.  **Work Package Map** (5-Worker parallelization)
5.  **Risk Register** (Known unknowns)

## Rules
- Do NOT merge plans yet. Keep them separate for cross-validation.
- All plans must start with **PROOF-OF-READ** (links actually opened).
