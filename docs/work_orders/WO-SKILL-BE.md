# WORK ORDER: SKILL-BE — Backend Skill Discovery

**Target Worker**: Backend
**Type**: Discovery (No Code)
**Priority**: Low (Parallel to main work)

## 1. Context
The Skills Governance system needs skill definitions for backend work. Worker (BE) is best positioned to identify what skills are needed for Supabase, SQL, multiplayer networking, and data schema tasks.

## 2. Task
Propose 2-4 skills that would help future Backend workers. You may NOT edit `docs/SKILLS_GOVERNANCE.md` directly.

## 3. Deliverable Format
For each proposed skill, provide:

```
Proposed Skill ID: skill-<area>-<name>
Scope: (what tasks it enables)
Constraints: (negative capabilities / what it must NOT do)
When to Use: (triggers for assignment)
Example: (2-3 bullet points of typical usage)
```

## 4. Candidate Areas
- Supabase SDK patterns
- SQL / RLS policies
- WebRTC / PeerJS signaling
- Real-time channel management
- Database schema design
- Edge Functions

## 5. Output
Paste your proposals in a `[ROUTING]` block addressed to Orchestrator.
