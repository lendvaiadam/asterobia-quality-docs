# WORK ORDER: SKILL-QA — QA/Test Skill Discovery

**Target Worker**: QA
**Type**: Discovery (No Code)
**Priority**: Low (Parallel to main work)

## 1. Context
The Skills Governance system needs skill definitions for QA/testing work. Worker (QA) is best positioned to identify what skills are needed for unit testing, integration testing, determinism verification, and HU test scenarios.

## 2. Task
Propose 2-4 skills that would help future QA workers. You may NOT edit `docs/SKILLS_GOVERNANCE.md` directly.

## 3. Deliverable Format
For each proposed skill, provide:

```
Proposed Skill ID: skill-<area>-<name>
Scope: (what tasks it enables)
Constraints: (negative capabilities / what it must NOT do)
When to Use: (triggers for assignment)
Example: (2-3 bullet points of typical usage)
```

## 4. Candidate Areas
- Vitest / Jest patterns
- Playwright E2E testing
- Determinism verification
- HU test scenario writing (Hungarian)
- Mock/stub creation
- Regression testing
- Performance benchmarking

## 5. Output
Paste your proposals in a `[ROUTING]` block addressed to Orchestrator.
