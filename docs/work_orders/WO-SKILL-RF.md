# WORK ORDER: SKILL-RF — Refactor/Review Skill Discovery

**Target Worker**: Refactor
**Type**: Discovery (No Code)
**Priority**: Low (Parallel to main work)

## 1. Context
The Skills Governance system needs skill definitions for refactor/review work. Worker (RF) is best positioned to identify what skills are needed for code cleanup, documentation sync, linting, and architectural review tasks.

## 2. Task
Propose 2-4 skills that would help future Refactor workers. You may NOT edit `docs/SKILLS_GOVERNANCE.md` directly.

## 3. Deliverable Format
For each proposed skill, provide:

```
Proposed Skill ID: skill-<area>-<name>
Scope: (what tasks it enables)
Constraints: (negative capabilities / what it must NOT do)
When to Use: (triggers for assignment)
Example: (2-3 bullet points of typical usage)
```

## 4. Candidate Areas
- Code cleanup patterns
- Documentation sync (markdown)
- ESLint / linting rules
- Dead code removal
- Dependency auditing
- Architecture review
- Naming convention enforcement

## 5. Output
Paste your proposals in a `[ROUTING]` block addressed to Orchestrator.
