# WORK ORDER: SKILL-FE — Frontend Skill Discovery

**Target Worker**: Frontend
**Type**: Discovery (No Code)
**Priority**: Low (Parallel to main work)

## 1. Context
The Skills Governance system needs skill definitions for frontend work. Worker (FE) is best positioned to identify what skills are needed for Three.js, Web Components, CSS, and input handling tasks.

## 2. Task
Propose 2-4 skills that would help future Frontend workers. You may NOT edit `docs/SKILLS_GOVERNANCE.md` directly.

## 3. Deliverable Format
For each proposed skill, provide:

```
Proposed Skill ID: skill-<area>-<name>
Scope: (what tasks it enables)
Constraints: (negative capabilities / what it must NOT do)
When to Use: (triggers for assignment)
Example: (2-3 bullet points of typical usage)
```

## 4. Candidate Areas
- Three.js scene management
- WebGL shaders
- Web Components (vanilla)
- CSS / responsive design
- Input handling / controls
- HUD / overlay systems
- Render interpolation

## 5. Output
Paste your proposals in a `[ROUTING]` block addressed to Orchestrator.
